# Age-Invariant Face Recognition App

<em>The **Age-Invariant Face Recognition System** is a **Streamlit-based web application** that verifies if two face images belong to the same person, regardless of age differences.  
It uses **InsightFace (buffalo_l)** for robust face detection and recognition, with **age-adaptive thresholds** optimized for different age gaps, and includes **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for age prediction capabilities.</em><br>
